## Description

This application provides back-end database control and route functionality for the social networking application ThoughtWorld, which allows registered users to post thoughts, add friends, and react to the thoughts of others. In developing this app I experienced some challenges working with Mongoose to generate the responses I wanted from various GET routes through Express, although I'm ultimately satisfied with the results and consider development of a front-end user interface to be the major goal for future development of ThoughtWorld.
